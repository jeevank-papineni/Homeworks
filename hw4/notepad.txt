1> why we use java script?

--> JavaScript allows you to create highly responsive interfaces that improve the user experience and provide dynamic functionality, without having to wait for the server to react and show another page.
--> Javascript you can validate field-by-field rather than waiting until the user has completely filled out the screen and clicked a submit button. 
--> JavaScript adds behaviour to the web page where the web page is capable of responding to actions by your visitors without needing to load a new web page in order to process their request.

2> what is dom manipulation?

-->  The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.



3> what are events in a web page? how can you recognize them

--> onchange	
--> onclick	
--> onmouseover	
--> onmouseout	
---> onkeydown	
-->  onload
